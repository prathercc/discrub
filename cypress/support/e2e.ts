/**
 * Cypress wipes localStorage and cookies between tests automatically,
 * but NOT IndexedDB. After our storage migration to IDB-backed
 * `storage.ts` (per-purpose databases under the `Discrub-` prefix),
 * persisted settings/cache/etc. leak across tests and cause
 * order-dependent flakes.
 *
 * Defense in depth — clear in both places:
 *   1. `beforeEach` here, against whatever AUT window the previous test
 *      left behind. Handles the most common case (test N→N+1).
 *   2. Inside `cy.login()` (see commands.ts), AFTER `cy.visit()` puts
 *      the AUT on localhost:3000. Handles the first-test-of-session
 *      case where (1) might run against about:blank.
 *
 * Also wipes the legacy `keyval-store` database so tests that exercise
 * the migration path can reseed it deterministically.
